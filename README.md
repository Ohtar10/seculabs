# Security Labs (seculabs)
This repository contains several IT security related stuff I had in need of doing at some point.
This is for purely reference only and nothing in this should be considered a production ready product.

## Contents
**certs**

Contains dummy certificates and how to generate them, starting from the RootCA and using it for an intermediateCA
 and finally a certificate suitable to establish a TLS communication.
